# Real-Time Sign Language Translator (Flask + TensorFlow)

This project is a real-time sign language recognition and translation system built using **Flask**, **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and a deep learning model trained with **TensorFlow**. It captures hand gestures via webcam, processes them on the server, and displays live predictions through a web interface.


## Features

-  Real-time sign language recognition from webcam
-  Word prediction using a trained TensorFlow model
-  Hand tracking and landmark extraction using MediaPipe
-  Web-based interface built with HTML + Socket.IO
-  Text-to-speech support (reads translated sentences aloud)
-  Live statistics like session time and word count

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/BerfinU/sign-language-translator.git
cd sign-language-translator

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


## Run the Flask app

python3 app2.py
Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000


##  How It Works

1. Click **"Start Camera"** on the UI.  
2. Webcam feed is sent to the backend.  
3. Each frame is processed using **MediaPipe** to extract hand landmarks.  
4. Landmarks are passed to the trained **TensorFlow** model.  
5. Predicted words are displayed and spoken in real time.


## 🧠 Model Info

- **Architecture:** LSTM-based sequence model  
- **Trained on:** Custom sign gesture dataset  
- **Input:** Hand landmarks (x, y, z) per frame  
- **Output:** Word or character prediction


## Requirements
See requirements.txt for full list.
